# **Surfs_up Climate Analysis**

## **Background**
Hawaii is known for its tropical climate throughout the year. Although when it comes to making business decisions, it is better to rely on the analysis backed by data rather than anecdotes.

## **Purpose**

The analysis aims to understand the climate at Oahu, Hawaii, to gauge if it is worth opening a surf shop and which location would be more preferable. We would like to analyse the weather in June (peak summer month) and December (peak winter month) to see the differences in Oahu's summer v/s winter climate.

## **Results**

The key differences in the temperature are depicted in the table and the diagram below:

Based on our temperature analysis done in 'Surfsup_Challange.ipynb', below are the key differences between the weather in June and December.
- The weather data collected in December is marginally less compared to the June data.
- The average temperature is slightly higher in June compared to December.
- The standard deviation for June data is marginally lower (3.25) than the December data (3.74), representing there are few more days in December where the temperature is more likely to drop way outside of three quartiles.

## **Summary**

We have analysed the temperature data for June and December, and the histograms for both months have been illustrated below:

![Temperature in December](https://github.com/jaykansara2019/surfs_up/blob/8338093a22400e9dc97001b08e34b9980b9e59de/Temperature%20in%20December.png)

Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the differences in the temperature between June and December are subtle. While there are marginal differences, December would still be ideal for surfing compared to the mainland USA.

Additional analysis in the precipitation could be performed to understand the differences throughout the year. The graph below gives a high-level understanding of the precipitation at Oahu. There are quite a few deviations in the precipitation records, but it should not negatively affect the surf business. Overall, based on the data analysis, W.Avy could convince the investor for his new venture.
